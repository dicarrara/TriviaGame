# TriviaGame

This is a quiz game that uses HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery. It also incorporates the use of two timers:

the first timer is activated when a new question is displayed. If the question is answered before the 20 second timer counts down, then the timer is reset and the correct answer is displayed, with a relevant img. If the question is not answered before timeout, the correct answer and the giphy still display. Stats are updated at this time, either way.

the second timer is activated as soon as the answer is displayed, whether it is triggered by an expired timeout or an answered question. It only counts for 3 seconds - enough time to read the correct answer, see the new score and enjoy the img - before the next question is automatically displayed.

When the quiz is completed you will see your score.
